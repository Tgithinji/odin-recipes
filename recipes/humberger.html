    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon liquid smoke flavoring</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>seasoned salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and 
            lightly oil the grate.
        </li>
        <li>Combine ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, 
            liquid smoke, and garlic powder in a medium bowl; 
            lightly mix until just combined. With minimal handling, 
            form mixture into three patties. Brush oil onto both 
            sides of each patty, then season with salt.
        </li>
        <li>Cook patties on the preheated grill until no 
            longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes per side. 
            An instant-read thermometer inserted into 
            the center should read at least 160 degrees F 
            (70 degrees C).
        </li>       
    </ol>
